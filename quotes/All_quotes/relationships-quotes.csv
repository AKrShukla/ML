"“When someone loves you, the way they talk about you is different. You feel safe and comfortable.”","Jess C. Scott,",relationships
"“I no longer believed in the idea of soul mates, or love at first sight. But I was beginning to believe that a very few times in your life, if you were lucky, you might meet someone who was exactly right for you. Not because he was perfect, or because you were, but because your combined flaws were arranged in a way that allowed two separate beings to hinge together.”","Lisa Kleypas,",relationships
“Indifference and neglect often do much more damage than outright dislike.”,"J.K. Rowling,",relationships
"“I think you still love me, but we can’t escape the fact that I’m not enough for you. I knew this was going to happen. So I’m not blaming you for falling in love with another woman. I’m not angry, either. I should be, but I’m not. I just feel pain. A lot of pain. I thought I could imagine how much this would hurt, but I was wrong.”","Haruki Murakami,",relationships
"“The meeting of two personalities is like the contact of two chemical substances: if there is any reaction, both are transformed.”",Carl Gustav Jung,relationships

"“You can talk with someone for years, everyday, and still, it won't mean as much as what you can have when you sit in front of someone, not saying a word, yet you feel that person with your heart, you feel like you have known the person for forever.... connections are made with the heart, not the tongue.”",C. JoyBell C.,relationships

"“Man may have discovered fire, but women discovered how to play with it.”","Candace Bushnell,",relationships
"“It hurts to let go. Sometimes it seems the harder you try to hold on to something or someone the more it wants to get away. You feel like some kind of criminal for having felt, for having wanted. For having wanted to be wanted. It confuses you, because you think that your feelings were wrong and it makes you feel so small because it's so hard to keep it inside when you let it out and it doesn't coma back. You're left so alone that you can't explain. Damn, there's nothing like that, is there? I've been there and you have too. You're nodding your head.”","Henry Rollins,",relationships
"“We’re all seeking that special person who is right for us. But if you’ve been through enough relationships, you begin to suspect there’s no right person, just different flavors of wrong. Why is this? Because you yourself are wrong in some way, and you seek out partners who are wrong in some complementary way. But it takes a lot of living to grow fully into your own wrongness. And it isn’t until you finally run up against your deepest demons, your unsolvable problems—the ones that make you truly who you are—that we’re ready to find a lifelong mate. Only then do you finally know what you’re looking for. You’re looking for the wrong person. But not just any wrong person: it's got to be the right wrong person—someone you lovingly gaze upon and think, “This is the problem I want to have.”I will find that special person who is wrong for me in just the right way.”","Andrew  Boyd,",relationships
"“Well, it seems to me that the best relationships - the ones that last - are frequently the ones that are rooted in friendship. You know, one day you look at the person and you see something more than you did the night before. Like a switch has been flicked somewhere. And the person who was just a friend is... suddenly the only person you can ever imagine yourself with.”",Gillian Anderson,relationships
"“I mean, if the relationship can't survive the long term, why on earth would it be worth my time and energy for the short term?”","Nicholas Sparks,",relationships
"“Why is it,"" he said, one time, at the subway entrance, ""I feel I've known you so many years?""""Because I like you,"" she said, ""and I don't want anything from you.”","Ray Bradbury,",relationships

"“I will love you always. When this red hair is white, I will still love you. When the smooth softness of youth is replaced by the delicate softness of age, I will still want to touch your skin. When your face is full of the lines of every smile you have ever smiled, of every surprise I have seen flash through your eyes, when every tear you have ever cried has left its mark upon your face,I will treasure you all the more, because I was there to see it all. I will share your life with you, Meredith, and I will love you until the last breath leaves your body or mine.”","Laurell K. Hamilton,",relationships

"“To be fully seen by somebody, then, and be loved anyhow - this is a human offering that can border on miraculous.”","Elizabeth Gilbert,",relationships

“I want to be in a relationship where you telling me you love me is just a ceremonious validation of what you already show me.”,"Steve Maraboli,",relationships
“I suffer from girlnextdooritis where the guy is friends with you and that's it.”,Taylor Swift,relationships
"“Therefore, dear Sir, love your solitude and try to sing out with the pain it causes you. For those who are near you are far away... and this shows that the space around you is beginning to grow vast.... be happy about your growth, in which of course you can't take anyone with you, and be gentle with those who stay behind; be confident and calm in front of them and don't torment them with your doubts and don't frighten them with your faith or joy, which they wouldn't be able to comprehend. Seek out some simple and true feeling of what you have in common with them, which doesn't necessarily have to alter when you yourself change again and again; when you see them, love life in a form that is not your own and be indulgent toward those who are growing old, who are afraid of the aloneness that you trust.... and don't expect any understanding; but believe in a love that is being stored up for you like an inheritance, and have faith that in this love there is a strength and a blessing so large that you can travel as far as you wish without having to step outside it.”","Rainer Maria Rilke,",relationships
"“When we're incomplete, we're always searching for somebody to complete us. When, after a few years or a few months of a relationship, we find that we're still unfulfilled, we blame our partners and take up with somebody more promising. This can go on and on--series polygamy--until we admit that while a partner can add sweet dimensions to our lives, we, each of us, are responsible for our own fulfillment. Nobody else can provide it for us, and to believe otherwise is to delude ourselves dangerously and to program for eventual failure every relationship we enter.”",Tom Robbins,relationships
"“Man, when you lose your laugh you lose your footing.”","Ken Kesey,",relationships
"“Never marry at all, Dorian. Men marry because they are tired, women, because they are curious: both are disappointed.”","Oscar Wilde,",relationships
"“Every couple needs to argue now and then. Just to prove that the relationship is strong enough to survive. Long-term relationships, the ones that matter, are all about weathering the peaks and the valleys.”","Nicholas Sparks,",relationships
“I know enough to know that no woman should ever marry a man who hated his mother.”,"Martha Gellhorn,",relationships
"“Maybe its like you said before, all of us being cracked open. Like each of us starts out as a watertight vessel. And then things happen - these people leave us, or don’t love us, or don’t get us, or we don’t get them, and we lose and fail and hurt one another. And the vessel starts to crack in places. And I mean, yeah once the vessel cracks open, the end becomes inevitable. Once it starts to rain inside the Osprey, it will never be remodeled. But there is all this time between when the cracks start to open up and when we finally fall apart. And its only that time that we see one another, because we see out of ourselves through our cracks and into others through theirs. When did we see each other face to face? Not until you saw into my cracks and I saw into yours. Before that we were just looking at ideas of each other, like looking at your window shade, but never seeing inside. But once the vessel cracks, the light can get in. The light can get out.”","John Green,",relationships
"“People like to say love is unconditional, but it's not, and even if it was unconditional, it's still never free. There's always an expectation attached. They always want something in return. Like they want you to be happy or whatever and that makes you automatically responsible for their happiness because they won't be happy unless you are ... I just don't want that responsibility.”","Katja Millay,",relationships
"“Even though you may want to move forward in your life, you may have one foot on the brakes. In order to be free, we must learn how to let go. Release the hurt. Release the fear. Refuse to entertain your old pain. The energy it takes to hang onto the past is holding you back from a new life. What is it you would let go of today?”",Mary Manin Morrissey,relationships
"“When you don't talk, there's a lot of stuff that ends up not getting said.”","Catherine Gilbert Murdock,",relationships
"“For there to be betrayal, there would have to have been trust first.”","Suzanne Collins,",relationships
"“Usually adult males who are unable to make emotional connections with the women they choose to be intimate with are frozen in time, unable to allow themselves to love for fear that the loved one will abandon them. If the first woman they passionately loved, the mother, was not true to her bond of love, then how can they trust that their partner will be true to love. Often in their adult relationships these men act out again and again to test their partner's love. While the rejected adolescent boy imagines that he can no longer receive his mother's love because he is not worthy, as a grown man he may act out in ways that are unworthy and yet demand of the woman in his life that she offer him unconditional love. This testing does not heal the wound of the past, it merely reenacts it, for ultimately the woman will become weary of being tested and end the relationship, thus reenacting the abandonment. This drama confirms for many men that they cannot put their trust in love. They decide that it is better to put their faith in being powerful, in being dominant.”",bell hooks,relationships
"“Cheating and lying aren't struggles, they're reasons to break up.”","Patti Callahan Henry,",relationships
"“To say that one waits a lifetime for his soulmate to come around is a paradox. People eventually get sick of waiting, take a chance on someone, and by the art of commitment become soulmates, which takes a lifetime to perfect.”","Criss Jami,",relationships
"“Part of the problem with the word 'disabilities' is that it immediately suggests an inability to see or hear or walk or do other things that many of us take for granted. But what of people who can't feel? Or talk about their feelings? Or manage their feelings in constructive ways? What of people who aren't able to form close and strong relationships? And people who cannot find fulfillment in their lives, or those who have lost hope, who live in disappointment and bitterness and find in life no joy, no love? These, it seems to me, are the real disabilities.”","Fred Rogers,",relationships
“Our wounds are often the openings into the best and most beautiful part of us.”,David Richo,relationships
“Relationships dont always make sense. Especially from the outside”,"Sarah Dessen,",relationships
"“Every couple has ups and downs, every couple argues, and that’s the thing—you’re a couple, and couples can’t function without trust.”","Nicholas Sparks,",relationships
"“Lots of things can be fixed. Things can be fixed. But many times, relationships between people cannot be fixed, because they should not be fixed. You're aboard a ship setting sail, and the other person has joined the inland circus, or is boarding a different ship, and you just can't be with each other anymore. Because you shouldn't be.”",C. JoyBell C.,relationships
“I used to advertise my loyalty and I don't believe there is a single person I loved that I didn't eventually betray.”,"Albert Camus,",relationships
"“Those sweet lips. My, oh my, I could kiss those lips all night long.Good things come to those who wait.”","Jess C. Scott,",relationships
"“If a girl starts out all casual with a guy and she doesn't tell him that she wants a relationship, it will never become a relationship. If you give the guy the impression that casual is okay with you, that's all he'll ever want. Be straight with him from the start. If he gets scared and runs away, he wasn't right for you.”","Susane Colasanti,",relationships
“A dame that knows the ropes isn't likely to get tied up.”,Mae West,relationships
"“Relationships are mysterious. We doubt the positive qualities in others, seldom the negative. You will say to your partner: do you really love me? Are you sure you love me? You will ask this a dozen times and drive the person nuts. But you never ask: are you really mad at me? Are you sure you’re angry? When someone is angry, you don’t doubt it for a moment. Yet the reverse should be true. We should doubt the negative in life, and have faith in the positive.”","Christopher Pike,",relationships
“I may not always be with you But when we're far apartRemember you will be with meRight inside my heart”,"Marc Wambolt,",relationships
“I know my heart will never be the sameBut I'm telling myself I'll be okay”,Sara Evans,relationships
"“If you spend your time hoping someone will suffer the consequences for what they did to your heart, then you're allowing them to hurt you a second time in your mind.”",Shannon L. Alder,relationships
“We die to each other daily. What we know of other people is only our memory of the moments during which we knew them. And they have changed since then. To pretend that they and we are the same is a useful and convenient social convention which must sometimes be broken. We must also remember that at every meeting we are meeting a stranger.”,"T.S. Eliot,",relationships
“Women cannot complain about men anymore until they start getting better taste in them.”,Bill Maher,relationships
"“What we wait around a lifetime for with one person, we can find in a moment with someone else.”","Stephanie Klein,",relationships
"“Forgive the past. It is over. Learn from it and let go. People are constantly changing and growing. Do not cling to a limited, disconnected, negative image of a person in the past. See that person now. Your relationship is always alive and changing.”","Brian Weiss,",relationships
"“I was suffering the easily foreseeable consequences. Addiction is the hallmark of every infatuation-based love story. It all begins when the object of your adoration bestows upon you a heady, hallucinogenic dose of something you never dared to admit you wanted-an emotional speedball, perhaps, of thunderous love and roiling excitement. Soon you start craving that intense attention, with a hungry obsession of any junkie. When the drug is witheld, you promptly turn sick, crazy, and depleted (not to mention resentful of the dealer who encouraged this addiction in the first place but now refuses to pony up the good stuff anymore-- despite the fact that you know he has it hidden somewhere, goddamn it, because he used to give it to you for free). Next stage finds you skinny and shaking in a corner, certain only that you would sell your soul or rob your neighbors just to have 'that thing' even one more time. Meanwhile, the object of your adoration has now become repulsed by you. He looks at you like you're someone he's never met before, much less someone he once loved with high passion. The irony is,you can hardly blame him. I mean, check yourself out. You're a pathetic mess,unrecognizable even to your own eyes. So that's it. You have now reached infatuation's final destination-- the complete and merciless devaluation of self."" - pg 20-21”",Elizabeth Gilbert,relationships
"“Of course it hurt that we could never love each other in a physical way. We would have been far more happy if we had. But that was like the tides, the change of seasons--something immutable, an immovable destiny we could never alter. No matter how cleverly we might shelter it, our delicate friendship wasn't going to last forever. We were bound to reach a dead end. That was painfully clear.”","Haruki Murakami,",relationships
“nothing in this world was more difficult than love.”,Gabriel García Márquez,relationships
"“I think you are wrong to want a heart. It makes most people unhappy. If you only knew it, you are in luck not to have a heart.”","L. Frank Baum,",relationships
"“I care,"" he said in a trembling voice. ""I care so much that I do not know how to tell you without it seeming inconsequential compared to how I feel. Even if I am distant at times and seem as if I do not want to be with you, it is only because this scares me, too.”","Aimee Carter,",relationships
“Don't leave a piece of jewelry at his house so you can go back and get it later; he may be with his real girlfriend.”,"Amy Sedaris,",relationships
"“Books are a poor substitute for female companionship, but they are easier to find.”","Patrick Rothfuss,",relationships
"“It is an absolute human certainty that no one can know his own beauty or perceive a sense of his own worth until it has been reflected back to him in the mirror of another loving, caring human being.”","John Joseph Powell,",relationships
"“Because I can't help doing it,"" he said with a shrug. ""And hey, if I keep loving you, maybe you'll eventually crack and love me too. Hell, I'm pretty sure you're already half in love with me.""""I am not! And everything you just said is ridiculous. That's terrible logic.""Adrian returned to his crossword puzzle. ""Well, you can think what you want, so long as you remember-no matter how ordinary things seem between us-I'm still here, still in love with you, and care about you more than any other guy, evil or otherwise, ever will.""""I don't think you're evil.""""See? Things are already looking promising.”","Richelle Mead,",relationships
"“All I'm telling you to do is to be smart about it. Know that if this man isn't looking for a serious relationship, you're not going to change his mind just because you two are going on dates and being intimate. You could be the most perfect woman on the Lord's green earth-you're capable of interesting conversation, you cook a mean breakfast, you hand out backrubs like sandwiches, you're independent (which means, to him, that you're not going to be in his pockets)-but if he's not ready for a serious relationship, he going to treat you like sports fish.”","Steve Harvey,",relationships
"“He could totally be your boyfriend,"" [Angel] went on with annoying persistance. ""You guys could get married. I could be like a junior bridesmaid. Total could be your flower dog.""""I'm only a kid!"" I shrieked. ""I can't get married!""""You could in New Hampshire.""My mouth dropped open. How does she know this stuff? ""Forget it! No one's getting married!"" I hissed. ""Not in New Hampshire or anywhere else! Not in a box, not with a fox! Now go to sleep, before I kill you!”","James Patterson,",relationships
"“We kiss all the time."" I clear my throat, then add, ""We just...do it in private."" ""A smug expression crosses his face. ""I don't buy it for a second, 'cause if you were my girlfriend and a stud like me was livin' in your house, I'd kiss you in front of the guy every chance I got as a reminder."" ""A reminder of w-w-what?"" ""That you were mine.”","Simone Elkeles,",relationships

"“Every woman that finally figured out her worth, has picked up her suitcases of pride and boarded a flight to freedom, which landed in the valley of change.”",Shannon L. Alder,relationships
"“We die containing a richness of lovers and tribes, tastes we have swallowed, bodies we have plunged into and swum up as if rivers of wisdom, characters we have climbed into as if trees, fears we have hidden in as if caves. I wish for all this to be marked on by body when I am dead. I believe in such cartography - to be marked by nature, not just to label ourselves on a map like the names of rich men and women on buildings. We are communal histories, communal books. We are not owned or monogamous in our taste or experience.”","Michael Ondaatje,",relationships
"“You can measure the happiness of a marriage by the number of scars that each partner carries on their tongues, earned from years of biting back angry words.”","Elizabeth Gilbert,",relationships

“This is what happened in love. One of you cried a lot and then both of you grew sarcastic.”,"Lorrie Moore,",relationships
“When we face pain in relationships our first response is often to sever bonds rather than to maintain commitment.”,"bell hooks,",relationships
"“It takes three to make love, not two: you, your spouse, and God. Without God people only succeed in bringing out the worst in one another. Lovers who have nothing else to do but love each other soon find there is nothing else. Without a central loyalty life is unfinished.”","Fulton J. Sheen,",relationships
