"“One, remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Two, never give up work. Work gives you meaning and purpose and life is empty without it. Three, if you are lucky enough to find love, remember it is there and don't throw it away.”",Stephen Hawking,science
"“Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known.”",Carl Sagan,science
"“The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existence. One cannot help but be in awe when he contemplates the mysteries of eternity, of life, of the marvelous structure of reality. It is enough if one tries merely to comprehend a little of this mystery each day.—""Old Man's Advice to Youth: 'Never Lose a Holy Curiosity.'"" LIFE Magazine (2 May 1955) p. 64”",Albert Einstein,science
"“The fact that we live at the bottom of a deep gravity well, on the surface of a gas covered planet going around a nuclear fireball 90 million miles away and think this to be normal is obviously some indication of how skewed our perspective tends to be.”","Douglas Adams,",science
“The most beautiful experience we can have is the mysterious. It is the fundamental emotion that stands at the cradle of true art and true science.”,"Albert Einstein,",science
“Time is a drug. Too much of it kills you.”,"Terry Pratchett,",science
“We are just an advanced breed of monkeys on a minor planet of a very average star. But we can understand the Universe. That makes us something very special.”,Stephen Hawking,science

“The good thing about science is that it's true whether or not you believe in it.”,Neil deGrasse Tyson,science
"“Though my soul may set in darkness, it will rise in perfect light; I have loved the stars too fondly to be fearful of the night.”","Sarah   Williams,",science
"“Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less.”",Marie Curie,science
“Science is not only compatible with spirituality; it is a profound source of spirituality.”,"Carl Sagan,",science
"“For me, I am driven by two main philosophies: know more today about the world than I knew yesterday and lessen the suffering of others. You'd be surprised how far that gets you.”",Neil deGrasse Tyson,science
"“Your assumptions are your windows on the world. Scrub them off every once in a while, or the light won't come in.”",Isaac Asimov,science
"“Space is big. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly big it is. I mean, you may think it's a long way down the road to the chemist's, but that's just peanuts to space.”","Douglas Adams,",science
“If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants.”,"Isaac Newton,",science
"“If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe.”","Carl Sagan,",science
"“It would be possible to describe everything scientifically, but it would make no sense; it would be without meaning, as if you described a Beethoven symphony as a variation of wave pressure.”",Albert Einstein,science
“A thinker sees his own actions as experiments and questions--as attempts to find out something. Success and failure are for him answers above all.”,Friedrich Nietzsche,science
“Life would be tragic if it weren't funny.”,Stephen Hawking,science
“Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.”,"Arthur C. Clarke,",science
"“We are going to die, and that makes us the lucky ones. Most people are never going to die because they are never going to be born. The potential people who could have been here in my place but who will in fact never see the light of day outnumber the sand grains of Arabia. Certainly those unborn ghosts include greater poets than Keats, scientists greater than Newton. We know this because the set of possible people allowed by our DNA so massively exceeds the set of actual people. In the teeth of these stupefying odds it is you and I, in our ordinariness, that are here.We privileged few, who won the lottery of birth against all odds, how dare we whine at our inevitable return to that prior state from which the vast majority have never stirred?”","Richard Dawkins,",science
"“For me, it is far better to grasp the Universe as it really is than to persist in delusion, however satisfying and reassuring.”","Carl Sagan,",science
"“So this is it,"" said Arthur, ""We are going to die.""""Yes,"" said Ford, ""except... no! Wait a minute!"" He suddenly lunged across the chamber at something behind Arthur's line of vision. ""What's this switch?"" he cried.""What? Where?"" cried Arthur, twisting round.""No, I was only fooling,"" said Ford, ""we are going to die after all.”","Douglas Adams,",science

"“Physics is like sex: sure, it may give some practical results, but that's not why we do it.”",Richard P. Feynman,science
"“I can see how it might be possible for a man to look down upon the earth and be an atheist, but I cannot conceive how a man could look up into the heavens and say there is no God.”",Abraham Lincoln,science
"“In my opinion, we don't devote nearly enough scientific research to finding a cure for jerks.”",Bill Watterson,science
"“Who is more humble? The scientist who looks at the universe with an open mind and accepts whatever the universe has to teach us, or somebody who says everything in this book must be considered the literal truth and never mind the fallibility of all the human beings involved?”",Carl Sagan,science
“Do you know what we call opinion in the absence of evidence? We call it prejudice.”,"Michael Crichton,",science
"“If you try and take a cat apart to see how it works, the first thing you have on your hands is a non-working cat.”",Douglas Adams,science
“We are an impossibility in an impossible universe.”,Ray Bradbury,science
"“In science it often happens that scientists say, 'You know that's a really good argument; my position is mistaken,' and then they would actually change their minds and you never hear that old view from them again. They really do it. It doesn't happen as often as it should, because scientists are human and change is sometimes painful. But it happens every day. I cannot recall the last time something like that happened in politics or religion.”",Carl Sagan,science
“Wisdom is not a product of schooling but of the lifelong attempt to acquire it.”,Albert Einstein,science
“God does not play dice with the universe.”,"Albert Einstein,",science
"“Beware the irrational, however seductive. Shun the 'transcendent' and all who invite you to subordinate or annihilate yourself. Distrust compassion; prefer dignity for yourself and others. Don't be afraid to be thought arrogant or selfish. Picture all experts as if they were mammals. Never be a spectator of unfairness or stupidity. Seek out argument and disputation for their own sake; the grave will supply plenty of time for silence. Suspect your own motives, and all excuses. Do not live for others any more than you would expect others to live for you.”","Christopher Hitchens,",science
"“Science investigates; religion interprets. Science gives man knowledge, which is power; religion gives man wisdom, which is control. Science deals mainly with facts; religion deals mainly with values. The two are not rivals.”","Martin Luther King, Jr",science
“The most incomprehensible thing about the world is that it is at all comprehensible.”,Albert Einstein,science
"“I suppose it is tempting, if the only tool you have is a hammer, to treat everything as if it were a nail.”","Abraham Maslow,",science
"“I have a friend who's an artist and has sometimes taken a view which I don't agree with very well. He'll hold up a flower and say ""look how beautiful it is,"" and I'll agree. Then he says ""I as an artist can see how beautiful this is but you as a scientist take this all apart and it becomes a dull thing,"" and I think that he's kind of nutty. First of all, the beauty that he sees is available to other people and to me too, I believe. Although I may not be quite as refined aesthetically as he is ... I can appreciate the beauty of a flower. At the same time, I see much more about the flower than he sees. I could imagine the cells in there, the complicated actions inside, which also have a beauty. I mean it's not just beauty at this dimension, at one centimeter; there's also beauty at smaller dimensions, the inner structure, also the processes. The fact that the colors in the flower evolved in order to attract insects to pollinate it is interesting; it means that insects can see the color. It adds a question: does this aesthetic sense also exist in the lower forms? Why is it aesthetic? All kinds of interesting questions which the science knowledge only adds to the excitement, the mystery and the awe of a flower. It only adds. I don't understand how it subtracts.”",Richard P. Feynman,science
"“The problem, often not discovered until late in life, is that when you look for things in life like love, meaning, motivation, it implies they are sitting behind a tree or under a rock. The most successful people in life recognize, that in life they create their own love, they manufacture their own meaning, they generate their own motivation. For me, I am driven by two main philosophies, know more today about the world than I knew yesterday. And lessen the suffering of others. You'd be surprised how far that gets you.”",Neil deGrasse Tyson,science
"“For, after all, how do we know that two and two make four? Or that the force of gravity works? Or that the past is unchangeable? If both the past and the external world exist only in the mind, and if the mind itself is controllable – what then?”","George Orwell,",science
“We are stuck with technology when what we really want is just stuff that works.”,"Douglas Adams,",science
"“I do not feel obliged to believe that the same God who has endowed us with sense, reason, and intellect has intended us to forgo their use.”","Galileo Galilei,",science
"“Whether or not you believe in God, you must believe this: when we as a species abandon our trust in a power greater than us, we abandon our sense of accountability. Faiths… all faiths… are admonitions that there is something we cannot understand, something to which we are accountable. With faith we are accountable to each other, to ourselves, and to a higher truth. Religion is flawed, but only because man is flawed. The church consists of a brotherhood of imperfect, simple souls wanting only to be a voice of compassion in a world spinning out of control.”","Dan Brown,",science
"“Reading, after a certain age, diverts the mind too much from its creative pursuits. Any man who reads too much and uses his own brain too little falls into lazy habits of thinking.”",Albert Einstein,science
"“Student: Dr. Einstein, Aren't these the same questions as last year's [physics] final exam?Dr. Einstein: Yes; But this year the answers are different.”",Albert Einstein,science
"“I like the scientific spirit—the holding off, the being sure but not too sure, the willingness to surrender ideas when the evidence is against them: this is ultimately fine—it always keeps the way beyond open—always gives life, thought, affection, the whole man, a chance to try over again after a mistake—after a wrong guess.”","Walt Whitman,",science
"“Every atom in your body came from a star that exploded. And, the atoms in your left hand probably came from a different star than your right hand. It really is the most poetic thing I know about physics: You are all stardust. You couldn’t be here if stars hadn’t exploded, because the elements - the carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, iron, all the things that matter for evolution and for life - weren’t created at the beginning of time. They were created in the nuclear furnaces of stars, and the only way for them to get into your body is if those stars were kind enough to explode. So, forget Jesus. The stars died so that you could be here today.”",Lawrence M. Krauss,science
"“Science is not only compatible with spirituality; it is a profound source of spirituality. When we recognize our place in an immensity of light‐years and in the passage of ages, when we grasp the intricacy, beauty, and subtlety of life, then that soaring feeling, that sense of elation and humility combined, is surely spiritual. So are our emotions in the presence of great art or music or literature, or acts of exemplary selfless courage such as those of Mohandas Gandhi or Martin Luther King, Jr. The notion that science and spirituality are somehow mutually exclusive does a disservice to both.”","Carl Sagan,",science
"“Even if there is only one possible unified theory, it is just a set of rules and equations. What is it that breathes fire into the equations and makes a universe for them to describe? The usual approach of science of constructing a mathematical model cannot answer the questions of why there should be a universe for the model to describe. Why does the universe go to all the bother of existing?”","Stephen Hawking,",science
"“I am an atheist, out and out. It took me a long time to say it. I've been an atheist for years and years, but somehow I felt it was intellectually unrespectable to say one was an atheist, because it assumed knowledge that one didn't have. Somehow, it was better to say one was a humanist or an agnostic. I finally decided that I'm a creature of emotion as well as of reason. Emotionally, I am an atheist. I don't have the evidence to prove that God doesn't exist, but I so strongly suspect he doesn't that I don't want to waste my time.”",Isaac Asimov,science
"“I don't accept the currently fashionable assertion that any view is automatically as worthy of respect as any equal and opposite view. My view is that the moon is made of rock. If someone says to me 'Well, you haven't been there, have you? You haven't seen it for yourself, so my view that it is made of Norwegian Beaver Cheese is equally valid' - then I can't even be bothered to argue. There is such a thing as the burden of proof, and in the case of god, as in the case of the composition of the moon, this has shifted radically. God used to be the best explanation we'd got, and we've now got vastly better ones. God is no longer an explanation of anything, but has instead become something that would itself need an insurmountable amount of explaining. So I don't think that being convinced that there is no god is as irrational or arrogant a point of view as belief that there is. I don't think the matter calls for even-handedness at all.”",Douglas Adams,science
"“From the standpoint of daily life, however, there is one thing we do know: that we are here for the sake of each other - above all for those upon whose smile and well-being our own happiness depends, and also for the countless unknown souls with whose fate we are connected by a bond of sympathy. Many times a day I realize how much my own outer and inner life is built upon the labors of my fellow men, both living and dead, and how earnestly I must exert myself in order to give in return as much as I have received.”",Albert Einstein,science
"“For millions of years, mankind lived just like the animals. Then something happened which unleashed the power of our imagination. We learned to talk and we learned to listen. Speech has allowed the communication of ideas, enabling human beings to work together to build the impossible. Mankind's greatest achievements have come about by talking, and its greatest failures by not talking. It doesn't have to be like this. Our greatest hopes could become reality in the future. With the technology at our disposal, the possibilities are unbounded. All we need to do is make sure we keep talking.”",Stephen Hawking,science
"“We can judge our progress by the courage of our questions and the depth of our answers, our willingness to embrace what is true rather than what feels good.”",Carl Sagan,science
“I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something.”,Richard P. Feynman,science
"“The scientist is not a person who gives the right answers, he's one who asks the right questions.”",Claude Levi-Strauss,science
“Scientists have calculated that the chances of something so patently absurd actually existing are millions to one.But magicians have calculated that million-to-one chances crop up nine times out of ten.”,"Terry Pratchett,",science
"“You will be required to do wrong no matter where you go. It is the basic condition of life, to be required to violate your own identity. At some time, every creature which lives must do so. It is the ultimate shadow, the defeat of creation; this is the curse at work, the curse that feeds on all life. Everywhere in the universe.”","Philip K. Dick,",science
"“How dreadful are the curses which Mohammedanism lays on its votaries! Besides the fanatical frenzy, which is as dangerous in a man as hydrophobia in a dog, there is this fearful fatalistic apathy. The effects are apparent in many countries. Improvident habits, slovenly systems of agriculture, sluggish methods of commerce, and insecurity of property exist wherever the followers of the Prophet rule or live. A degraded sensualism deprives this life of its grace and refinement; the next of its dignity and sanctity. The fact that in Mohammedan law every woman must belong to some man as his absolute property – either as a child, a wife, or a concubine – must delay the final extinction of slavery until the faith of Islam has ceased to be a great power among men. Thousands become the brave and loyal soldiers of the faith: all know how to die but the influence of the religion paralyses the social development of those who follow it. No stronger retrograde force exists in the world. Far from being moribund, Mohammedanism is a militant and proselytizing faith. It has already spread throughout Central Africa, raising fearless warriors at every step; and were it not that Christianity is sheltered in the strong arms of science, the science against which it had vainly struggled, the civilisation of modern Europe might fall, as fell the civilisation of ancient Rome.”","Winston Churchill,",science
"“If there is any religion that could respond to the needs of modern science, it would be Buddhism.”",Albert Einstein,science
“Science is organized knowledge. Wisdom is organized life.”,"Will Durant,",science
“The first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool.”,Richard P. Feynman,science
"“Science is interesting, and if you don't agree you can fuck off.Note: Dawkins was quoting a former editor of New Scientist Magazine, who is as yet unidentified (possibly Jeremy Webb)”",Richard Dawkins,science
“The opposite of a correct statement is a false statement. But the opposite of a profound truth may well be another profound truth.”,Niels Bohr,science
"“I do not know what I may appear to the world, but to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the sea-shore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.”",Isaac Newton,science
"“Science, my lad, is made up of mistakes, but they are mistakes which it is useful to make, because they lead little by little to the truth.”","Jules Verne,",science
"“The day science begins to study non-physical phenomena, it will make more progress in one decade than in all the previous centuries of its existence.”",Nikola Tesla,science
"“I'm a pessimist because of intelligence, but an optimist because of will.”","Antonio Gramsci,",science
“Our civil rights have no dependence on our religious opinions any more than our opinions in physics or geometry...”,"Thomas Jefferson,",science
“I don't want to believe. I want to know.”,Carl Sagan,science
“We are a way for the cosmos to know itself.”,"Carl Sagan,",science
"“How is it that hardly any major religion has looked at science and concluded, “This is better than we thought! The Universe is much bigger than our prophets said, grander, more subtle, more elegant?” Instead they say, “No, no, no! My god is a little god, and I want him to stay that way.” A religion, old or new, that stressed the magnificence of the Universe as revealed by modern science might be able to draw forth reserves of reverence and awe hardly tapped by the conventional faiths.”","Carl Sagan,",science
"“When we read, another person thinks for us: we merely repeat his mental process. In learning to write, the pupil goes over with his pen what the teacher has outlined in pencil: so in reading; the greater part of the work of thought is already done for us. This is why it relieves us to take up a book after being occupied with our own thoughts. And in reading, the mind is, in fact, only the playground of another’s thoughts. So it comes about that if anyone spends almost the whole day in reading, and by way of relaxation devotes the intervals to some thoughtless pastime, he gradually loses the capacity for thinking; just as the man who always rides, at last forgets how to walk. This is the case with many learned persons: they have read themselves stupid.”","arthur schopenhauer,",science
